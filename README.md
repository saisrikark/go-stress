stress code with easy control

Why do I want this?
I've been seeing this issue where stressing code is very irritating
I want to call a function and stress it easily
Have a wrapper function support to execute before and after the testcase
This should take some values
Maybe some manipulation can happen here
And we can send stuff to the main function that needs to be executed
